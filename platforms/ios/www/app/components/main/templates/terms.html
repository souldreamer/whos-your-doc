          musical instruments, sports equipment),
          the passenger must contact our client service. In this case, an additional fee can be charged for luggage.
          <br><br>In the case that the passenger does not notify us the fact that he/she needs extra space for luggage we
          cannot guarantee that the passenger’s luggage will be transported taking into account that our vehicle
          capacity is limited. This
          thing can lead to our inability to transport passengers/luggage or passengers must wait a longer time for
          their transport to be organized. If we cannot supply the transport in a satisfactory way because of this
          reason, we cannot accept
          any complaint for this fact. We do not transport animals in our vehicles (with the exception of guide dogs).
          If the passenger wishes to travel with his guide animal, the passenger must inform us about this at the moment
          of booking.
          More than that, we will refuse the transport of any elements which are also exculded by the flight companies.
          <br><br> All our partners have insurance for luggage, the rules of insurance policies may differ in details. In

          regulations of the transport location.
          <br><br> If damage occurs during transportation at the passengers luggage (physical damage, lost luggage, and
          theft) we can accept a refund request in case our colleague is notified on the spot about the event. In case
          of physical damage,
          we can accept a refund request in case that, according to our colleague’s decision, exterior damage signs are
          visible on the luggage which was intact at the beginning of transport. The passenger must demand a written
          statement from
          our colleague in which it proves he/she was notificed on the spot about the event.
          <br><br>If the passenger luggage was stolen, the passenger must report the event at the local police station in
          term of 1 working day. We can accept any refund request for luggage damage to passenger’s in case that the
